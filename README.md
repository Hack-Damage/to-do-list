# Follow Thru
*The ToDo list you won't ignore.* 

The idea behind Follow Thru was to make a todo list that pairs you with another person anonymously. You can see their todo list and they can see yours. The intention is that the matched up people will hold each other accountable for finishing what they say they're going to do.

This would work well as a mobile app, however that is something to pursue at a later date. 

This was built by [Daniel Montgomery](https://github.com/danielmontgomery),  [Elisa Johnson](https://github.com/elisajohnson), and [Chris Chandler](https://github.com/chricloud9) as Project 3 of [General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive).
